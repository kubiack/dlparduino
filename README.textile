h1. dlparduino

DPL-IO8 Compatible firmware/sketch for Arduino-like boards.


h2. Project Goal

Provide a drop-in replacement for DLP-IO hardware using an off-the-shelve Arduino-compatible board.


h2. Planned features

# Digital out control (high/low)
# Digital in reading
# Analog in reading


h2. Features NOT planned

# DS18B20 digital temperature sensor reading.
# Binary protocol


h2. Incompatibilities

Due to the Arduino hardware, not all pins have analog-to-digital converter available. Only digital in/out will be available on some pins.

h2. Current status

Nothing done, a new project just started.


h2. Communication setup

115200 bauds, no parity, 8bits data, 1 stop bit, no flow control


h2. Protocol description

This is the DLP-IO8 protocol.
